Stable release
--------------

To install Collatz Tree, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install collatz_tree

This is the preferred method to install Collatz Tree, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

You can also install the most recent stable release from the `github releases`_ page. This can be installed using pip as well.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install collatz_tree-v*-py3-none-any.whl

Finally, you can download standalone binaries from the `github releases`_ page as well. These can be used in the same way.
